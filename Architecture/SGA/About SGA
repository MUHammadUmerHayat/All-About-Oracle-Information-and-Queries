Flashback buffer:
  Is an optional component in the SGA. When Flashback Database
  is enabled, the background process called Recovery Writer Process (RVWR) is
  started. RVWR periodically copies modified blocks from the buffer cache to the
  flashback buffer, and sequentially writes Flashback Database data from the
  flashback buffer to the Flashback Database logs, which are circularly reused

Redo log buffer:
  Is a circular buffer in the SGA that holds information about
  changes made to the database. This information is stored in redo entries. Redo
  entries contain the information necessary to reconstruct (or redo) changes that
  are made to the database by data manipulation language (DML), data definition
  language (DDL), or internal operations. Redo entries are used for database
  recovery if necessary. 

Memoptimize Pool:
  Is an optional component that provides high performance and
  scalability for keybased queries. The Memoptimize Pool contains two parts, the
  memoptimize buffer area and the hash index. Fast lookup uses the hash index
  structure in the memoptimize pool providing fast access to the blocks of a
  given table (enabled for MEMOPTIMIZE FOR READ) permanently pinned in the buffer
  cache to avoid disk I/O. The buffers in the memoptimize pool are completely
  separate from the database buffer cache. The hash index is created when the
  Memoptimized Rowstore is configured, and is maintained automatically by Oracle
  Database.
