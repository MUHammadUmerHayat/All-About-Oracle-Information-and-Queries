Deferred Inserts Pool:
  The fast ingest feature enables high-frequency, single-row data inserts into
  database for tables defined as MEMOPTIMIZE FOR WRITE. The inserts by fast
  ingest are also known as deferred inserts. They are initially buffered in the
  large pool and later written to disk asynchronously by the Space Management
  Coordinator (SMCO) and Wxxx slave background processes after 1MB worth of
  writes per session per object or after 60 seconds. Any data buffered in this
  pool, even committed, cannot be read by any session, including the writer,
  until the SMCO background process sweeps. The pool is initialized in the
  large pool at the first inserted row of a memoptimized table. 2G is allocated
  from the large pool when there is enough space. If there is not enough space
  in the large pool, an ORA4031 is internally discovered and automatically
  cleared. The allocation is retried with half the requested size. If there is
  still not enough space in the large pool, the allocation is retried with 512M
  and 256M after which the feature is disabled until the instance is restarted.
  Once the pool is initialized, the size remains static. It cannot grow or
  shrink.
