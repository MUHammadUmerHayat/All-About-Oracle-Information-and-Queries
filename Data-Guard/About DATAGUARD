{ Main difference between physical and logical standby databases

  The main difference between physical and logical standby databases is the manner in which apply services apply the archived redo data:

  - For physical standby databases, Oracle Data Guard uses REDO APPLY
    technology, which applies redo data on the standby database using standard
    recovery techniques 

  - For logical standby databases, Oracle Data Guard uses SQL APPLY technology,
    which first transforms the received redo data into SQL statements and then
    executes the generated SQL statements on the logical standby database,

}
{ Redo transport services

  Authentication, either
    • SSL
        Prerequiesites
          - DBs members of same OID (Oracle Internet Directory) enterprise domain
          - The LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_n, and FAL_SERVER database initialization parameters that
            correspond to the databases use Oracle Net connect descriptors configured for SSL
          - Each database has an Oracle wallet or supported hardware security module that
            contains a user certificate with a distinguished name (DN) that matches the DN in
            the OID entry for the database
    • or remote password file

}
{ Application continuity

  Application Continuity is an Oracle Database feature that enables rapid and
  nondisruptive replays of requests against the database after a recoverable
  error that made the database session unavailable.

  Application Continuity is supported for Oracle Data Guard switchovers to
  physical standby databases. It is also supported for fast-start failover to
  physical standbys in maximum availability data protection mode. Note that
  primary and standby databases must be licensed for Oracle RAC or Oracle
  Active Data Guard in order to use Application Continuity.
  

}
{ Redo / SQL Apply

  Redo Apply: applies redo data on the standby database using standard recovery techniques 

  SQL Apply: first transforms the received redo data into SQL statements and then executes the generated SQL statements on the logical standby database

}
{ Switchover vs Failover

  Fast-start failover {

    A high availability architecture requires a fast failover capability for
    databases and database clients.

   - Oracle Data Guard Broker determines if fail over is necessary
     and initiates the failover to the specified target standby database automaticall
    (No need for a DBA)

  }
  { Client failover

   Client failover encompasses
    - failure notification,
    - stale connection cleanup,
    - and transparent reconnection to the new primary database.
   
   Oracle Database provides the capability to integrate database failover with
   failover procedures that automatically redirect clients to a new primary
   database within seconds of a database failover.

{ Creating environment

  A LOGICAL STANDBY database is initially created as an identical copy of the primary database, but it later can be altered to have a different structure. 

  Create phys. or log. standby DB from backup copy of prim db.

  RMAN - DUPLICATE to create a standby database from backups of your primary database.

{ Protection modes

  → https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SBYDB/protection.htm#SBYDB02000

}
{ FORCE LOGGING

  To protect against unlogged direct writes in the primary database that cannot
  be propagated to the standby database, turn on FORCE LOGGING at the primary
  database before performing data file backups for standby creation. Keep the
  database in FORCE LOGGING mode as long as the standby database is required

}
{ Fast-start failover target

  you cannot use the SQL  
    ALTER DATABASE MOVE DATAFILE
  command to rename or relocate an online data file on a physical standby that
  is a fast-start failover target if the standby is mounted, but not open.

}
{ Creating a DG environment

  { Primary DB

    • Enable forced logging
      ALTER DATABASE FORCE LOGGING;
    • Configure Redo Transport Authentication
    • Configure the primary(?) DB to receive redo data
    • set primary DB init params
    • enable archiving

  }
