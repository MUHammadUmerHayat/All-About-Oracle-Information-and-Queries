RAC enables multiple independent servers that are linked by an interconnect to
share access to an Oracle database, providing
 - high availability,
 - scalability,
 - and redundancy
during failures. 

RAC addresses system failures by providing rapid and automatic recovery from
failures, such as node failures and instance crashes.
