database server manageability:
  self-tuning,
  self-diagnosing
database
technologies in the database kernel so that the database
can manage itself out of the box.
- automatically speed up execution time of a SQL and
- to self-diagnose performance bottlenecks in slow-running systems (even high-powered clustered database environments).
- covrs cross-tier performance diagnostics,
- automated self-tuning for emergency situations, and
- building data interfaces for innovative user interfaces (UIs) to empower DBAs to navigate performance data captured in the database.

{ DBMS_ADVISOR etc

  DBMS_ADVISOR is part of the server manageability suite of advisors, a set of
  expert systems that identifies and helps resolve performance problems relating
  to database server components. 

  Some advisors have their own packages. For these advisors, Oracle recommends that you use the advisor-specific package rather than DBMS_ADVISOR. Each of the following advisors has its own package, tailored to its specific functionality:
     -  Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (DBMS_ADDM)
     -  SQL Performance Analyzer (DBMS_SQLPA)
     -  SQL Repair Advisor (DBMS_SQLDIAG)
     -  SQL Tuning Advisor (DBMS_SQLTUNE)
     -  Compression Advisor (DBMS_COMPRESSION.GET_COMPRESSION_RATIO)
  SQL Access Advisor and Segment Advisor are the only advisors with common use cases for DBMS_ADVISOR. Undo Advisor and Compression Advisor do not support DBMS_ADVISOR subprograms.
