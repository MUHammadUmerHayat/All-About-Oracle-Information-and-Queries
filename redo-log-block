ORA-00354: corrupt redo log block header

    Cause: The block header on the redo block indicated by the accompanying
    error, is not reasonable.

    Action: Do recovery with a good version of the log or do time based
    recovery up to the indicated time. If this happens when archiving,
    archiving of the problem log can be skipped by clearing the log with the
    UNARCHIVED option. This must be followed by a backup of every datafile to
    insure recoverability of the database.
